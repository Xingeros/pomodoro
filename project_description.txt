Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a simple Pomodoro Clock Web App using React.js. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals separated by short breaks. This Web App will help users stay focused and productive by providing a timer for each work session.

What you will learn in this Project:
- Structuring a Web App Layout.
- Application of Basic CSS (Cascading Style Sheet).
- Utilizing React.js for building interactive user interfaces.
- Implementing a countdown timer functionality.
- Managing state and handling user interactions.

Core Features (Must have):
- Display a countdown timer set to 25 minutes, representing a work session.
- Include buttons for "Start", "Pause", and "Reset".
- When the "Start" button is clicked, the timer should begin counting down from 25 minutes.
- The "Pause" button should pause the countdown timer.
- The "Reset" button should reset the timer back to 25 minutes.

Advanced Features (Extras you can do):
- Enhance the visual design of the timer and buttons using CSS.
- Add sounds or visual cues when the timer reaches zero or when buttons are clicked.
- Implement a session history feature to track completed work sessions.
- Include a settings menu where users can customize the duration of work sessions and breaks.
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for controlling the timer (e.g., Spacebar to start/pause, R key to reset).
- Utilize React Router to create multiple pages, such as a "Settings" page or a "Session History" page.

Feel free to refer to the provided example folder for inspiration, but focus on adapting the features to create a Pomodoro Clock Web App. This project will help solidify your understanding of React.js and enhance your skills in building user-friendly web applications.
